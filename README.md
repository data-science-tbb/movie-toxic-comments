Attempts to solve [Kaggle Toxic Comments Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)


With continuous increase in available data, there is a pressing need to organize it and modern classification problems often involve the prediction of multiple labels simultaneously associated with a single instance.
Known as Multi-Label Classification, it is one such task which is omnipresent in many real world problems.

In this project, using a Kaggle problem as example, we explore different aspects of multi-label classification.

### Birdâ€™s-eye view of the project:
* Part-1: Overview of Multi-label classification.
* Part-2: Problem definition & evaluation metrics.
* Part-3: Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Part-4: Data pre-processing.
* Part-5: Multi-label classification techniques.
